# janky-emojis
A friend found a couple janky emojis online somewhere and I liked them so I made a bunch more. 

These should play nice with slack. A couple are big so there is a transparent background to shrink them where possible.

### But these all look terrible
ya, they are janky

Credit me where you can, there isn't a way to do that in slack so don't worry about it there. I don't have any money to go after anyone anyway.
